SELF JOIN
A self join joins another copy of a table to itself
It is used to compare rows of the same table
Helps to display a hierachy of data.



A self join is a way to join a table with itself.
This can be useful when you have a table that contains a hierarchical structure or when you want to compare rows within the same table.

To perform a self join in MySQL, you need to use an alias for the table that you want to join. Here is an example of a self join query:

 you need to use an alias for the table that you want to join

SELECT a.customer_id , a.first_name, a.last_name FROM " customers AS a "LEFT JOIN "customers AS b" ON a.referral_id = b.customer_id


HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE

SELECT e1.employee_name, e2.employee_name
FROM employees AS e1
JOIN employees AS e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;


YOU CAN USE INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN E.TC




In this example, we are joining the employees table with itself using the manager_id and employee_id columns.
The first instance of the table is given the alias e1 and the second instance is given the alias e2.
We are selecting the employee_name column from both instances of the table.

This query will return a list of employees and their respective managers.

It is important to note that self joins can be resource-intensive and may impact the performance of your database.
Therefore, it is recommended to use them sparingly and only when necessary.
